properties
===============
used to access private fields from another class

if we using function, directly  we can't change the properties value, first we have to assign 
funtion value to one variable and then we can perform any operation

but using properties directly we can access and change the value 

Delegates
============
same signatures with multiple method implns

it should be same return type and parameters

method name can be different

In interface same signatures one implns

Constants
===============
value should assign at comile time
we can't reassign or change

Readonly
===============
Readonly is the keyword whose value we can change during runtime or we can assign it at run time 
but only through the non-static constructor. Not even a method.

Static ReadOnly
================
this variable's value can only be changed in the static constructor. 
And cannot be changed further. It can change only once at runtime

Authorization is a process of allowing or denying resources to particular user or record 
=============

Authentication is a process where we identify the credentials of user i.e. username, password and create an identity to mention user as an authenticated
================

“Convert” function handles NULLS while
“.ToString()” does not it will throw a NULL reference exception error. So as a good coding
practice using “convert” is always safe

Primary key does not allow the null values but unique key allows one null value.
Primary key will create clustered index on column but unique key will create non-clustered index by default.

paging
=========
if you want to display large amount records in gridview, we use paging and display set of few records
in each gridview pages. Sorting feature used to sort the records based on the selected columns 
in gridview and display the records in ascending or descending order

To use these options in our gridview we need to set AllowPaging="true" and PageSize="5" Properties
 here pageSize

<PagerSettings Mode="NextPreviousFirstLast" PageButtonCount="4" PreviousPageText="Previous"
 NextPageText="Next" FirstPageText="First" LastPageText="Last" />

PAGE LIFE CYCLE
==================
SILVER
S = Start 
I  = Initialization
L = Load
V = Validate
E = Event Handlers
R = Render

PAGE REQUEST:
page properties such as Request and Response are set.
At this stage, the page also determines whether the request is a postback or a new request 
sets the IsPostBack property

INITIALIZATION:
each control's UniqueID property is set
A master page and themes are also applied 

LOAD:
calls the OnLoad method - all controls are loaded
to establish database connections

VALIDATE & EVENT HANDLING:
event handlers are called - handle specific control events, such as a Button control's Click event or a TextBox control's TextChanged event
all validator controls is called

RENDER:
he page calls the Render method - hat writes its output to the OutputStream object of the page's Response property.

UNLOAD:
page properties such as Response and Request are unloaded
cleanup is performed.

VIEWSTATE
=============
ViewState is used to maintain the value of controls during page postback
